        <p>The reason is simple – nothing matches the satisfaction and fulfillment that comes from alleviating the suffering of others, a core tenet of charity involvement. Their smiles of gratitude are worth the world, and the feeling of seeing the fruits of your labor of love is unmatched.</p>
        <p>You’ll want to see those smiles again and again. The reward that someone feels when he/she decides to help someone who is going through a tough time is fulfilling beyond belief. It is almost like you feel you need to keep on helping, because you need to keep your heart satisfied and healthy.</p>

Our organization accepts donations of all kinds to assist in our developmental work, aid, and relief. An easy way to double your contribution is through employee giving programs. Many corporations match employee donations (or the tax- deductible component of your membership) to our organization. If you volunteer with us, your employer may also provide us with a grant as a way to recognize your ongoing support. Thanks for checking to see if your company offers these programs!</p>
