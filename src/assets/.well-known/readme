Register domains for payment methods

Register and verify domains to use payment methods (including Link, Apple Pay, and Google Pay) in Elements or Checkout's embeddable payment form.

To use certain payment methods with Elements or Checkoutâ€™s embeddable payment form, you must register every web domain that will show the payment method. This includes registering top-level domains and subdomains. For example, if you have the domain yourdomain.com and subdomains like shop.yourdomain.com and www.yourdomain.com, this guide explains how to register them.

After you register a domain, that domain is ready for use with other payment methods that you might enable in the future.

The following payment methods require registration:

Google Pay
Link
PayPal
Apple Pay (additional verification step required)
